# Arduino Ultrasonic Sensor Measure Detection

The purpose of the ultrasonic movement preceptor system is to analyze and embody the movements of an object in a way that produces useful data to help control simple systems. In the prototype stage the movements are captured in 1D hence the use of simplistic systems. Ideally the system could be expanded into full 4D and encapsulate the entire object in order to fully replicate motion in a computer system.
